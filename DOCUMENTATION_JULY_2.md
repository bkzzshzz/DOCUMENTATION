#### Learned

1. Relative path. A dot followed by a forward slash i.e. `./` is the current folder and all the linking to other pages should be done with respect to this address. 

#### Achieved:

1. Generalized the code for all pages in blog-posts and python_html_css_blog including the all-posts(lists all files within blog-posts folder) file. A quirky method to tackle the problem when the file or the GET request is invalid was done by using boolean :) .
