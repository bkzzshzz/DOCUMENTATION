### Git

1. `git reset` reverts to the latest version of the file
2. `.gitignore` file stores the list of files that are ignored for committing in git

### Python

1. So, I was tasked with displaying the list of files in a folder on an html page. **os** library does the work. By importing _os_ and with the code: `list_name = os.listdir(folder_name)`. One point to remember --> __`os.listdir()` returns a list__
2. To solve the task, I got the idea of making a completely new file. But adding the double quotes was as hassle for a while but overcame it in an instant. `\"` to write double-quotes within double-qoutes.
