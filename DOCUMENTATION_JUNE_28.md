1. Most of my files had reduntant and repetitive contents. So, to make it more memory efficient and clean and **pro**, I put some placeholders like `{header}` and `{scripts}` in html _template_ pages where they are required. Then the usual things, *converting* the template file to a string, *formatting* the string as required, then writing the formatted string to another file was done.
