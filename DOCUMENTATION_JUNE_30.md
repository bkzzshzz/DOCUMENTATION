### Learned:

1. About `if statements`.
```python
if 'any_string':
    statements
    ...
    ...
```
This is always true. Also:
```python
if <condition> or 'any_string':
    statements
    ...
    ...
```
is also always true. Because the `any_string` part is not a null value. Since, it has some value in it, it is always true.

2. Managing folders for rendered and template files. The rendered files are everchanging and thus needs to be kept in __.gitignore__ folder. The template files are never edited in the course of serving.

3. `.gitkeep`. This file displays the empty folder as well in git repo. It has to be kept inside an empty folder and committed.
